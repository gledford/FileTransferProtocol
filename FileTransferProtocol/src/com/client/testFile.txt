1. The Sinner


Digging a hole that I can't get out of
Deeper and deeper below the surface 
To find that there's nothing there
Where do I go from here?
Give me something that I can feel!
Back and forth here we go again
What will it take to keep it together?

What will it take to keep it together?
What will it take?
What will it take?
What will it take to keep it together?
I've never felt so empty

Keep me close, keep me close
Keep my head above water
I need to hear your voice 
I can't do this on my own

Beneath the sun I am rotting
Just like the ones that came before me
I cannot deny my own walk has become a crawl
I've never felt so
I've never felt so lost

I know 
I could never run far enough
To escape your love
(To escape your love)
So why do I keep running?

Now the chaos is all around me
Show me the light at the end of the tunnel
I need you to save me from myself
Give me something I can feel!

Keep me close, keep me close
Keep my head above water
I need to hear your voice 
I can't do this on my own
(I can't do this on my own)

Keep me close, keep me close
(Keep my head above water)
I can't do this on my own

Take all my guilt
Take all my pride
I want to know you sincerely
I'm on my knees
Take all of me
I want to feel you here with me
Feel you here with me!

Take all my guilt
Take all my pride
I want to feel you here with me

Keep me close, keep me close
Keep my head above water
I need to hear your voice 
I can't do this on my own
(I can't do this on my own)

Keep me close, keep me close
(Keep my head above water)
I can't do this on my own


2. The Unfaithful


Say what you wanted to say,
Mean what you wanted to mean.
I'm listening, so be real with me.

I've never known you to be
One that refuses to speak.
You've never held anything back from me until now,
What were you thinking?

I can see it in your eyes,
You're scared for your life.
And I would be too if I was you,
I would be too if I was you!

Say what you wanted to say,
Mean what you wanted to mean.
I'm listening, so be real with me.
Say what you wanted to say,
Mean what you wanted to mean.
I'm listening, so be real with me.

I'll rip every single word
Right out of your dirty mouth.
I'll rip every single word
Right out of your dirty mouth!

Don't test me, I'll do it.
I have all of the evidence, I'll prove it.
Don't test me, I'll do it.
I have all of the evidence!

For better or for worse,
It never meant a thing!

Say what you wanted to say,
Mean what you wanted to mean.
I'm listening, so be real with me.
Say what you wanted to say,
Mean what you wanted to mean.
I'm listening, so be real with me.

How many days have I wasted,
Building you up while you tear me down?
I swear the next time you need me,
I won't be around!

Everything we had is gone,
It was gone in the blink of an eye.
Pack all your bags,
I've never been so ready to say goodbye.

Love, hate, pleasure and pain.
These are the words I could never explain,
All I know is you made me feel every one
And it will never happen again!

How am I to blame
For all your mistakes?
You gave up the second you looked away.
I really hope you got what you wanted,
Now wash your hands clean of me.
Won't you wash your hands clean of me?

I forgive you, 
I just want you to leave.
For better or for worse,
It never meant a thing.
I forgive you, 
I just want you to leave.
For better or for worse,
It never meant a thing.


3. The Victim


I think it's time
We paid a little closer attention to all of this
Your slight of hand is an old trick
And I see right through your wit

So I'll ask you
Can you keep your word?
Or is this where we go our separate ways?
Can you keep your word?
Never again will I trust what you say!

I never thought I could be so blind
Oh, but now I say
If I could go back
Do it all again
You know that I wouldn't sign my life away

You won't get away with this! 
You won't get away with this! 
Silent when we needed you!
You won't get away with this! 
You won't get away with this! 
Silent when we need you!

I was too blind to see that
You were too deaf to hear me
Just know if I could go back
This would all be different
This would all be different!

You must have mistaken me
For someone just as fake as you
You broke every promise you made!
No, I don't expect you to know what it feels like
I just want you to admit
That you are a thief
You're a thief!
You're a thief!
You're a thief!

Don't take it too hard my friend
That I feel this way
It's just that

I was too blind to see that
You were too deaf to hear me
Just know if I could go back
This would all be different
This would all be different!

Your excuses mean nothing
When nothing means more than keeping your word
Oh please
Like I haven't heard them before?
I don't think you'll ever learn

You killed the trust
All of the trust that I put in you!
You killed the trust
And I'll never trust you again!

I was too blind to see that
You where too deaf to hear me
Just know if I could go back
This would all be different

I was too blind to see that
You where too deaf to hear me
Just know if I could go back
This would all be different


4. The Abandoned


Staring at the wall,
I never thought this would be so hard.
How could have I been so close and never known you?
I never knew, I never knew you at all!

You will always be my father but I hope you know,
It's your fault and I'll never know what that means.
You left a void that never could be replaced.
I am dying inside but you will never see!

I always had hoped that you did not want it this way,
But no matter how hard I try you always pushed away.

You said you loved me but...

How was I supposed to know
(How was I supposed to know)
When you left here,
You left me here alone?
Do I ever even cross your mind,
Just for second?
Do you know I'm alive?

You know I would let you in but you threw everything away.
So tell me what did you get from all of these years of pain?
You have no clue what I've been through, 
But I guess that you wanted it that way!

How was I supposed to know
(How was I supposed to know)
When you left here,
You left me here alone?
Do I ever even cross your mind,
Just for second?
Do you know I'm alive?

If you would've been there,
If you would've stuck around.
If you would've been there when I needed you,
You would've been
You would've been so proud!

How was I supposed to know
(How was I supposed to know)
When you left here,
You left me here alone?
Do I ever even cross your mind,
Just for second?
Do you know I'm alive?


5. The Deceived


Maybe one day you'll see what you did to me,
But until then, I need you to know you make me sick!

I know that you think that you're changing,
I know that you think you're perfect.
But your yesterday is a joke
And everyone's heard it all before!

You'll never give me what I know I deserve,
The same as all of the rest but with half the nerve!

I should have known,
(I should have known!)
I should have seen
How much was wrong.
You're a mistake.
You're a mistake, a disease on my soul!

I can't believe I thought I had you figured out.
I should have known,
I should have seen how much was wrong.
I should have known,
I should have seen that you were broken.
You were broken from the start.

I gave you all of of me.
Put you first in line, such a waste of time.
I was always yours, you were never mine.
How could you leave me standing outside?

You're such a sick, sad waste of a human being!
I hope you're happy, go paint that smile
Right back on your face, you're so fake.
I'm so tired of all the generic excuses,
So this, this is where I draw the line.
With every "I love you" you left me more empty.
And now it is so obvious...

You were broken,
You were broken from the start.
I should have known,
I should have seen how much was wrong!

I gave you all of of me.
Put you first in line, such a waste of time.
I was always yours, you were never mine.
How could you leave me standing outside?

When you hear these words
And wonder if they're about you,
Don't call and complain.
You know there's truth
In every word that I say!

You're such a sick, sad waste of a human being.
You're such a sick, sad waste of a human being!

I gave you all of of me.
Put you first in line, such a waste of time.
I was always yours, you were never mine.
How could you leave me standing outside?

I gave you all of me,
Such a waste of time.
This is where I draw the line,
This is where I draw the line!


6. The Commanded


I felt the ground start to shake.
Oh God, oh God,
Everything's up in flames.
I prayed that it would have ended
Just as fast, just as fast as it came.

All I could hear was:
"March on, march on.
Quick on your feet,
March on, march on.
March on, march on.
Whether you like or not,
March on, march on!"

Finish what you started.
Just remember you can't bring them back,
Just remember you can't bring them back.

Heads will roll, bullets will fly.
We've all been turned into blood thirsty cannibals.
Just don't close your eyes!
Just don't close your eyes,
Sleep with one open!

Everything's put into perspective
When you're staring down
The barrel of a gun.
I've come to peace with the fact
That I can't take it back,
What's done is done!

But the bodies still haunt my dreams,
Oh, the bodies still haunt my dreams.
The bodies still haunt my dreams
And they always will!

March on, march on.
March on, march on.
Quick on your feet!

Finish what you started.
Just remember you can't bring them back,
Just remember you can't bring them back.
Finish what you started.
Just remember you can't bring them back,
(Just remember)
Just remember you can't bring them back.

How many of them will be forgotten,
Laying a part of the ashes?
No words can describe the guilt,
But I had no choice!

We were surrounded,
No words can describe.
We were surrounded, 
I had no choice.
Words can't describe
The guilt that I felt,
But I had no choice.

Finish what you started.
Just remember You can't bring them back,
(Just remember)
Just remember You can't bring them back.
Finish what you started.
Just remember You can't bring them back,
(Just remember)
Just remember You can't bring them back.

How many of them will be forgotten,
Laying among of the ashes?


7. The Burden (Interlude)




8. The Haunted


Dancing with the heat 
From your ear against mine
Made me a victim to love
A love that was never divine

You were my first
I hated it all
Oh I hated it all
Always there to show me
The next place to fall
Cause you knew I would fall

You were so far from
Anything I ever wanted
Temptation took over
And now everywhere that I go
I am haunted

Hello (Hello)
Hello and goodbye
Here is to hoping that I
That I can forget everything 
About that night

Hello (Hello)
Hello and goodbye
Here is to hoping that I
I never see you again in my life

Really I can't blame anyone 
But myself
I could have stopped it
Oh I wish I did

I knew nothing but visions until you
I robbed myself of my own innocence
You came back more vicious
Than ever before

I should have seen it coming
You were perfect
Perfectly covered in blood
And I saw right through you

Evil!
Pure Evil!
Evil!

The look in your eyes
Your intentions were poison

Hello (Hello)
Hello and goodbye
Here is to hoping that I
That I can forget everything 
About that night

Hello (Hello)
Hello and goodbye
Here is to hoping that I
I never see you again in my life

No!
You didn't brand me
No!
You didn't brand me!

You didn't brand me!
You're just a bump in the road!
Soon I'll wake up from this nightmare
And I will be happy
And you'll be alone

I saw right through you
Your intentions were poison
I saw right through you
It's the look in your eyes

Hello (Hello)
Hello and goodbye
Here is to hoping that I
That I can forget everything 
About that night

Hello (Hello)
Hello and goodbye
Here is to hoping that I
I never see you again in my life


9. The Reality


These streets are crowded with cowards disguised as men.
They are paying no consequence for their actions, 
So we'll all give in.

I say the same things
Over and over and over again,
But you act like you've never heard them.
We were created to set an example.
So what is this, what is this?

This is the same old story,
This is the same old scene.
We're living our lives right out of a magazine,
I guess we'll never know!

Have we gone from little to less,
To nothing at all, nothing at all?
It seems like every soul
Has been sold for a dollar or less.
So I guess we'll never know
How good it could have been.
How good it could have been!

Savor every breath
That enters your lungs,
I promise it won't last forever.
And by the time you realize
You were wrong, you'll be far gone.

Savor every breath
That enters your lungs,
I promise it won't last forever.
And by the time you realize
You were wrong, you'll be far gone!

Follow me or back out now.
Follow me with all your heart
Or back out, back out now!

We all swim in a sea of pride,
Where character is rare.
(Where character is rare)
With every passing day,
It only gets worse
And no one seems to care.

We all die wondering what if I-
What if I would have tried?
And while you're begging for life on you knees,
You'll realize you were never happy!

Have we gone from little to less,
To nothing at all, nothing at all?
It seems like every soul
Has been sold for a dollar or less.
I guess we'll never know
How good it could have been.

The clouds begin to move in rhythm,
There is a storm in the sky.

I will cause a disaster,
Create an earthquake
And watch as you shake.
I will cause a disaster,
Watch as you shake!

We all die wondering what if I-
What if I would have tried?
What if I would have tried?

I guess we'll never know!

It seems like every soul
Has been sold for a dollar or less.
I guess we'll never know
How good it could have been.
How good it could have been!


10. The Redeemed


Let go of everything, 
Let go of everything!

What is it that you are holding on to?
What will it matter when every history book is consumed in the flames?
Soon it will be like you never existed,
Not a single soul will remember your name!

Everyone is flawed,
Everyone has a story to tell.
But every story has an ending,
So stop acting like there won't be one!

These bones are only, only temporary.
(Let go of all you know.)
You're on your own, but not alone.
You'll never be alone.

These bones are temporary,
Let go of all you know.
(Let go of all you know.)
The destination lies ahead
And we are not alone.
We are not alone!

Forget then, live right now.
Everything rides on tomorrow.
When that day comes will you hear (will you hear)
"Well done, well done."?

Your eternity is worth so much
More than their opinions of you.
Defined not by where you've been,
Knowing that you'll be made new!

These bones are only, only temporary.
(Let go of all you know.)
You're on your own, but not alone.
You'll never be alone.

These bones are temporary,
Let go of all you know.
(Let go of all you know.)
The destination lies ahead
And we are not alone.
We are not alone!

I can't say 
The past will never get in the way.
Just remember, all things come and go,
But they don't mean a thing.
It's not about what you have now,
It's what you have in store.

Let go.
The destination lies ahead
And we are not alone.
(It's not about what you have now,
What do you have in store?)

Let go.
These bones are only temporary,
We are not alone.
(It's not about what you have now,
What do you have in store?)

Let go. (These bones are only temporary)
The destination lies ahead
And we are not alone.
(You're on your own, but not alone.
What do you have in store?)

Let go. (These bones are only temporary)
These bones are only temporary,
We are not alone.
(You're on your own, but not alone.
You'll never be alone.)
